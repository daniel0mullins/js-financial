## Synopsis

This is a set of financial functions written in JavaScript.

## Code Example

    pmt = function(rate_per_period, number_of_payments, present_value, future_value, type);

## Motivation

I had a need for some financial functions for client side code, and none existed where I could find them - so I made my own! Now sharing so someone can be lazy where I couldn't!

## Installation

Just reference in the `<head>` of your document. Currently functions just exist in the global namespace ... bad form, I know. I'll get around to modularizing this soon.
